- Add `abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days` to all S3 buckets.
- [Issue 167](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/apiary-data-lake/issues/167) Fix gluesync in ECS deployments.

## [6.4.1] - 2020-06-18
### Fixed
- [Issue 162](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/apiary-data-lake/issues/162) Add explicit dependency for S3 public access block to resolve race condition.

## [6.4.0] - 2020-06-16
### Added
- Create `apiary_system` database and buckets. This is pre-work for Ranger access logs Hive tables and other system data. Requires `apiary-metastore-docker` version `1.15.0` or above.

## [6.3.0] - 2020-06-08
### Added
- Added support for SSE-KMS encryption in Apiary managed S3 bucket.

## [6.2.1] - 2020-05-27
### Changed
- Optional `customer_principal` and `producer_iamroles` in Apiary managed bucket policies.

## [6.2.0] - 2020-05-11
### Added
- Variable to deny IAM roles access to Apiary managed S3 buckets.

## [6.1.3] - 2020-05-11
### Changed
- Set min/max size of HMS thread pool based on memory.  Max will be set to 1 connection for every 2MB RAM.  Min will be 0.25% of max.  This will prevent large HMS instances from not having enough threads/connections available.


## [6.1.2] - 2020-05-07
### Changed
- Change type of `apiary_managed_schemas` from `list(any)` to `list(map(string))` to support dynamically-generated schema lists. This type is backward-compatible with previous schema lists.  Schema lists were already lists of maps of strings, but this change makes TF 0.12 work in certain circumstances that were causing a fatal TF error.

## [6.1.1] - 2020-05-04
### Changed
- Fix multiple instance deployment on k8s.

## [6.1.0] - 2020-04-21
### Added
- If Apiary's default S3 access log management is enabled (i.e., `var.apiary_log_bucket` is not set by the user), signal the Hive metastore to create the Hive database `s3_logs_hive` on startup. This is pre-work to prepare for S3 access-log Hive tables in a future version of Apiary. Requires `apiary-metastore-docker` version `1.13.0` or above.


## [6.0.0] - 2020-04-08
### Added
- Per-schema option to send S3 data notifications to an SQS queue.  See `enable_data_events_sqs` in the [apiary_managed_schemas](VARIABLES.md#apiary_managed_schemas) section of [VARIABLES.md](VARIABLES.md)
### Changed
- Changed AWS resources created on a per-schema basis to use Terraform `for_each` instead of `count`.  This includes S3 and SNS resources.
  - This was done to fix the issue of removing a schema in a later deployment.  If the schema removed is not at the end of the `apiary_managed_schemas` list, then when using `count`, Terraform will see different indexes in the state file for the other resources, and will want to delete and recreate them. Using `for_each` references them by `schema_name` in the state file and fixes this issue.
- The following variables changed type from `string` to `bool` since the `string` was acting as a boolean pre-TF 0.12:
  - `db_apply_immediately`, `enable_hive_metastore_metrics`, `enable_gluesync`, 
  - `enable_metadata_events`, `enable_data_events`, `enable_s3_paid_metrics`
### Removed
- Removed variable `s3_block_public_access` - Blocking of public access to Apiary S3 buckets is now mandatory.
- Removed quoted variable types in `variables.tf` to follow Terraform 0.12 standards and remove warnings.
### Notes
- *THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE.* When deploying `6.0.0` on an existing Apiary deployment, the following procedure must be followed:
  - See the `migrate.py` script in the `scripts` folder.
  - This script is used to migrate an Apiary Terraform state file from using `count` for resource indexing to using
      `for_each`, which is how apiary-data-lake v6.0.0+ handles indexed resources.  Without this script, doing an `apply` 
      will want to destroy all your S3 resources and then recreate them because they are stored in the `.tfstate` file
      differently.  
  - The migration script needs some external packages installed (see `migrate_requirements.txt`) and then should run in either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.6+.
  - This procedure assumes you have a Terraform app called `apiary-terraform-app` that is the application using this module.
  - Upgrade `apiary-terraform-app` to `apiary-data-lake` v5.3.2.  This will necessitate using Terraform 0.12+ and
    resolving any TF 0.12 incompatibilities in your application code.  TF 0.12.21+ is recommended (will be required later).
  - Plan and apply your Terraform app to make sure it is working and up-to-date.
  - Install Python 3 if you don't yet have a Python installation.
  - Install requirements for this script with `pip install -r migrate_requirements.txt`.
  - Run this script pointing to your terraform state file.  Script can read the state file from either file system or S3. Run it first with dryrun, then live.  Example:
    - `python migrate.py --dryrun --statefile s3://<bucket_name>/<path_to_statefile>/terraform.tfstate`
    - `python migrate.py --statefile s3://<bucket_name>/<path_to_statefile>/terraform.tfstate`
    - Note that appropriate AWS credentials will be needed for S3: AWS_PROFILE, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, etc.
  - Upgrade `apiary-terraform-app` to use `apiary-data-lake` v6.0.0. If you are not yet using TF 0.12.21+, please upgrade to 0.12.21.
  - Make _only_ the following changes to your `.tf` file that references the `apiary-data-lake` module. Don't make any additions or other changes:
    - If your app is setting `s3_block_public_access`, remove reference to that variable.  Public access blocks are now mandatory.
    - If your app is setting any of the following variables that changed type to `bool`, change the passed value to `true` or `false`:
      - `db_apply_immediately`, `enable_hive_metastore_metrics`, `enable_gluesync`, 
      - `enable_metadata_events`, `enable_data_events`, `enable_s3_paid_metrics`  
      - If current code is setting those to `"1"` (or anything non-blank), change to `true.`  If setting to `""`, change to `false`.
  - Now run a plan of your `apiary-terraform-app` that is using `apiary-data-lake` v6.0.0.  It should show no changes needed.
  - Now run an apply of the code.
  - Now you can make changes to use any other v6.0.0 features or make any other changes you want.  E.g, setting `enable_data_events_sqs` in schemas.
- This version of `apiary-data-lake` requires at least Terraform `0.12.21`
